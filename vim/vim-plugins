## Introduction

Vim is a powerful text editor, however, with some additional plugins, it would be even more powerful and easy to use.
This article will talk about some useful plugins that I love, but it might not be perfect for everyone.
So if you are interested in vim plugins, this article would best just serve the purpose to share what's available,
and if it works for you or not you will need to evaluate based on your use case and preference.

## Vim plugins manager
There are different vim plugins manager available, the one I am using is Vundle.vim.
https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim

Download the repo first
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

```
set nocompatible              " be iMproved, required
filetype off                  " required

" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()
" alternatively, pass a path where Vundle should install plugins
"call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')

" The sparkup vim script is in a subdirectory of this repo called vim.
" Pass the path to set the runtimepath properly.
Plugin 'rstacruz/sparkup', {'rtp': 'vim/'}

" To ignore plugin indent changes, instead use:
"filetype plugin on
"
